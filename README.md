# Testing:
Functional Testing Used Selenium to automate the testing of key user flows (e.g., task assignment, sales management).
Performance Testing Simulated 50 concurrent logins using JMeter to test server resilience. Contributing Fork the repository. Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature-name. Commit your changes: git commit -m "Add a new feature". Push to the branch: git push origin feature-name. Submit a pull request.
# Future Advancements
In the future, I plan to enhance my club management system to make it more general and adaptable for project management across various domains. This will involve integrating features such as MongoDB for efficient data handling, email notifications for seamless communication, scheduling meetings for better coordination, and team creation for structured collaboration. Additionally, I aim to implement file uploads and a dedicated work-related chat system to streamline project discussions. For scalability and reliability, I intend to deploy the system using AWS, ensuring a robust and efficient platform for managing projects beyond just clubs.
